- This folder contains scripts that are used to emulate commands.
- mrbs_cmd_default_val.json store the command with default values
- device_info.json store the device informations

* RUNNING:
    + Open the command prompt or terminal
    + $ python Hub_CMD.py [-argument, ... ... ...]

* NOTE: 
(1) use the command below to show help information
    + $ python Hub_CMD.py -h"

(2) Run the script with none argument -p, -i will run with default values which are stored in the device_info.json file
    + Eg: $ python Hub_CMD.py [--cmd_arg] will run with default port is 9999 and ip is 127.0.0.1
    + -p: option is used to configure port address
    + -i: option is used to configure IP address
    + -a: option is used to select the agent that is stored in JSON file (*). The argument will be index of UUID in json file (Eg: 1, 2, 3, ...)
    + -m: PanL70 MAC address
    + These arguments can use together: Eg: $ python Hub_CMD.py -p 63441 -i 127.0.0.1 -a 1 -m 16 [--cmd_argument ...]

    (*) The JSON file which stores agents UUID is generated by command --get_uuid
        $ python Hub_CMD.py --get_uuid
        The command above will get all the agent UUID from HUB and store in an agent_uuid_list.json file

(3) This script support almost command which is sent form MRBS HUB to Agent, each command will have a represent option
    + Eg, the represent option of command SET_ADDRESS_2AGENT is --set_address_2agent 

    If run command with none argument, script will run with command default configurations stored in mrbs_cmd_default_val.json  file
    + Eg: $ python Hub_CMD.py --set_address_2agent      : this command will run with default address is 16 that stored in JSON file
          $ python Hub_CMD.py --set_address_2agent 123  : this command will run with the address is 123
          $ python Hub_CMD.py --set_address_2agent help : this command will show help information about this

    + Other commands have the same usage with command mentioned above
